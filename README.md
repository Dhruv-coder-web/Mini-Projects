ðŸš€ Mini JavaScript Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini JavaScript projects that I built to test and improve my web development knowledge. These projects are great for practicing real-world logic, building UI components, and learning how JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS.

Whether youâ€™re a beginner looking to improve your JavaScript skills or someone revising the fundamentalsâ€”these projects will help you think logically, debug effectively, and code efficiently.
